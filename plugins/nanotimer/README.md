# nanotimer plugin

**Maintainer:** [2art](https://github.com/2art) <[2art@pm.me](mailto:2art@pm.me)>

This plugin adds a timer that times each executed command with down to nanoseconds acuracy, and then displays the time in right prompt.

To use it, add `nanotimer` to the plugins array of your zshrc file:

```zsh
plugins=(... nanotimer)
```
